## About

I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Economics at the University of Winnipeg and Principal Investigator of Ag/Health Economics at the Canadian Centre for Agri-Food Research in Health and Medicine (A mouthful, I know!). My research program is broad and covers a myriad of areas in applied and theoretical economics, health policy, nutrition, chronic disease, and statistics. My current research is focused on the economic development of Canadian First Nations communities through improvements in water infrastructure, nutrition, and overall health.
